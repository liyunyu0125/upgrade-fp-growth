  Based on FP-Growth Algorithm, an upgrade-FP-Growth algorithm is proposed, which is mainly for port simulation data with two data sets of “input and output”. It is applied in multi-dimensional port data analysis, and some data is selected as representative. It is used to demonstrate and analyze the example, which provides a theoretical basis and improvement direction for the design and modification of the port simulation system.
